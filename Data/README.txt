- Canada Air Pollution
The data is contained in the R file named "CanadaPM.RData". This file contains a
12x4017 matrix of PM2.5 values. The 12 rows represent the 12 stations for which
continuous records of PM2.5 exist between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2019. 
These temporal resolution of these data are on the daily scale and the PM2.5 data
are measured in micrograms/m^{-3}


- Indiana Climatology Data
The data is contained in the R file named "ICData.rda". This file contains a
12720x9 matrix named "station_int". The columns of this matrix represent the
variables being measured by the sensor as well as the time in which the measurement
was recorded. The variables of interest used throughout the manuscript are in columns
5 and 9 and are named "tempf" (Temperature in Farenheit) and "windspeedmph" (wind
speedm in mph) respectively. Data are recorded on the hourly level for each variable
from July 20, 2020 through December 31, 2021.
